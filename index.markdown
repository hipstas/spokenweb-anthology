*The SpokenWeb Digital Anthology* exhibits annotated audio and video recordings from literary archives across Canada. The anthology presents original research written to contextualize and newly theorize these recorded readings, panels, videopoems, and classroom visits by authors such as Kathy Acker, Irving Layton, Dorothy Livesay, Kaie Kellough, Roy Kiyooka, Daphne Marlatt, Michael McClure, and Muriel Rukeyser. This collaborative digital edition, edited by Zoe Bursztajn-Illingworth and Tanya Clement at the Univerity of Texas at Austin, contains projects contributed by Teddie Brock (Simon Frasier), Miranda Eastwood (Concordia), Matthew Kilbane (Notre Dame), Nadège Paquette (Concordia), Zach Morrison (University of Alberta), Rachel Pickard (UBCO), Emily Murphy (UBCO), Karis Shearer (UBCO), and Trent Wintermeier (UT Austin). We would be remiss not to acknowledge the conceptual help given to us by Jason Camlot (Concordia), attendees at the SpokenWeb Institute's Sonic Innovations roundtable, and funding from the Mellon Foundation and SSHRC that has made *The SpokenWeb Digital Anthology* possible.
