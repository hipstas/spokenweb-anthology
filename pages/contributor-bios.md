#### **Matthew Kilbane, University of Notre Dame**
Matthew Kilbane is the Glynn Family Honors Assistant Professor of English at the University of Notre Dame, where he teaches and writes about modern and contemporary poetry in the U.S., poetry and music, the history of sound technologies, and digital literary cultures. His first book, *The Lyre Book: Modern Poetic Media* (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2024), unfolds a disciplinary meeting place for literary and media studies around modern lyric poetry. Opening our lyric archives to such things as pop songs, radio poems, closet operas, and speech-music, the book’s media theory of the lyric shows how literary scholars can look to media history to understand transformations in the social life of poetry, and how media archaeologists can read lyric forms for insight into the cultural history of technology.

#### **Nadège Paquette, Concordia University**

Her work will appear in the forthcoming Plastic issue of *tba*, *Journal of Art, Media, and Visual Culture*, and appeared in the journal of comparative literature *Post-Scriptum*. Her research interests aggregate around the relationship between human and nonhuman forms of life and nonlife. In her piece “A Performance Reading by Kathy Acker: Formulating Affinities and Defiances through Discomfort,” she reflects on her own standpoint and is attentive to gender as an embodied knowledge and performance in her own listening as well as in Acker’s reading. The noises coming from Acker’s audience, produced through the interaction between objects and auditors, are considered as a way for the audience to “sound back” to the speaker and negotiate their consent in witnessing to representations of violence in Acker’s text.
